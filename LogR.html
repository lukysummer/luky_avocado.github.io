			<br><br><span id='scen'>The graph above shows the scatter plot of the raw training points: red dots for Not Purchased (0) & blue dots for 
			Purchased (1), along with the linear decision boundary generated by fitting Logistic Regression to the training set. The model predicts that 
			any new user with age & salary combination within the pink area will likely NOT purchase the car, while one within the blue area will likely
			purchase the car. Looking at the training accuracy (~0.82), nearly 18% of the original training points are mislocated into the opposite section.
			This error might be due to the small size of the dataset (400 points) as well as limiation of logistic regression's linear boundary.
