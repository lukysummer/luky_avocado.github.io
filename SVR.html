			By analyzing this data, you are asked to find the relationship between an employee's position level and salary. </span>

			<br><br>&nbsp;1. For <b>Python</b> implementation of SVR, <b>Feature Scaling</b> was performed on both x & y features since it is not 
			built in the SVR class. It removed the mean of the features and scaled the entries according to the variance of each entry compared to the mean.

			<br><br><span id='scen'>The graph above shows the scatter plot of the raw datapoints (red dots) & the support vector regression curve 
			(blue line). The blue curve seems to well-represent all the raw data points except the last one with the highest salary. This is because
			the <b>SVR model seems to assume that the last point is an outlier, thus giving it a big penalty in the SVR optimization objective</b>. 
			The model detects that the last point has a too-large y-value that strays away from the observed trend of the previous nine data points. 
			<b>This could be the case because the dataset is extremely small (with only 10 data points)</b>. Thus, it can be concluded that the SVR 
			model is not an optimal model for this particular dataset with too few points. It could perform better with a bigger dataset that contains 
			more points that support the trend of exponentially inrease in y with linear increase in x.
